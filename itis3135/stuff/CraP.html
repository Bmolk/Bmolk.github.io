            On April 30, 1789, George Washington, standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York,
            took his oath of office as the first President of the United States. “As the first of every thing, in our situation 
            will serve to establish a Precedent,” he wrote James Madison, “it is devoutly wished on my part, that these precedents 
            may be fixed on true principles.”
